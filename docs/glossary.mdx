## Introduction

Field Day is a collaborative project that involves students from various disciplines, primarily software engineering and wildlife biology. To facilitate communication and understanding between team members, we have compiled a glossary of terms that are commonly used in both fields. This glossary is a work in progress and will be updated as needed.

Terms marked with a 🖥️ symbol are related to software engineering, while terms marked with a 🐾 symbol are related to wildlife biology.

## Glossary

### C

<GlossaryEntry term="Capture Mark Recapture (CMR) 🐾" definition="A method used in wildlife biology to estimate an animal population's size. It involves capturing animals, marking them, releasing them, and then recapturing them to see how many marked animals are found." field="biology" />

### D

<GlossaryEntry term="Docusaurus 🖥️" definition="Docusaurus is a project for building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites easily. It is used to build the Field Day documentation site." field="software" />

### G

<GlossaryEntry term="Genus 🐾" definition="A rank in the biological classification system (taxonomy) that is above species and below family. It groups together species that are structurally similar or common in some way." field="biology" />

<GlossaryEntry term="GitHub 🖥️" definition="GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It allows multiple people to work on projects at the same time, track changes, and manage different versions of the project. To report issues or request features for Field Day, you will need a GitHub account." field="software" />
